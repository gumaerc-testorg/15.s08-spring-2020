Study Questions / Issues to Prepare
-----------------------------------

1.  What opportunities does the current insurance sector landscape and possible "pain points" present for ongoing technological disruption?
2.  How have machine learning, alternative data, and so-called "Internet of Things" devices begun to transform the underwriting, selling, administration, & claims processing of insurance?
3.  What are InsurTech trends and applications affecting each part of the insurance sector’s value chain? What are the capital, regulatory, and data challenges confronting startups in this space? To date, why have Big Tech firms been less engaged in insurance than other finance sectors?
